# MiniatuReddit
By Jonathan Luo, Matt Kiley, and Michael Hu


There are few HTML pages:
- index.html: Landing page and also where the main post board will be displayed (TBD filtering post by people, communities, controversial, etc.).
The posts here will show author, content, net like/dislike (no actual like/dislike ratio), the number of comments (not the comments themselves), and an option to like/dislike.
- post.html: A page for an individual post, showing author, content, like/dislike ratio, the comments themselves (option to like/dislike comments), option to like/dislike, and an option to leave a comment.
- profile.html: Show this user's individual profile: username,
their posts, and their latest comments. Option to delete and change password.
- login.html: Login into an existing account. Needed for any type of interactions
aside from just viewing posts from index.html.
- register.html: Create an account.
